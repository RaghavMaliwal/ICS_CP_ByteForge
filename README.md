Greetings,
Here we have our project of Matrices Operations Toolkit.
Below are the operations which can be performed in this toolkit:-
1. Sum
2. Difference
3. Scalar Multiplication
4. Pre Multiplication
5. Post Multiplication
6. Transpose
7. Co factor
8. Determinant
9. Adjoint
10. Inverse of matrix

Also, below are features of our code:-
1. NxM calculator
2. we can exit the operation after any calculation
3. use the answer for another operation in the given list 
4. additional edge cases checked - eg:- checking if inverse possible, checking if determinant of the given order is possible
5. interacting UI 

How to Execute the code:-
1. Run the given program 
2. After running, you will see a welcome message with the list of operation with their input specifiers (which are basically numbers which correspond to the respective operation), with an additional exit option
3. After entering any of the choice of operation provided, you'll get the message to enter the number of rows and columns of the first matrix.  ********Note:- Only positive integer values are accepted for entering the order of matrix********
4. Then if your given matrix is of order N x M, it shows Enter N x M Matrix, then you enter the elements of the matrix 
5. After entering the elements in the matrix, you get a confirmation message to whether to continue the operation through Y/N, (it's purpose is to give the user a chance to change the operation if he/she mistakenly chose wrong operation)
6. After that depending on the operation, the I/O panel continues to take input and print required output.
7. Also after displaying the result, the answer can be reused according to the user's wish, with the corresponding input instructions

*******Environment used******* - We have executed and run the code with the gcc compiler in VS Code, only in C language.
